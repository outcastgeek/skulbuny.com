If you use multiple accounts for Google Chrome, you'll know what the user-switcher avatar is. It's that little icon/image that represents your account in Google Chrome. My sister has her own account when she uses my laptop, so I see that little guy a lot, and it's nice to know that it now uses a picture of me instead of a ninja.

*A word of note: I'm running Google Chrome version 32.0.1659.2 dev. The steps to reproduce this may differ for you if you're running a different version of Google Chrome. On that note, this should work in Chromium as well.*

***You need an active Google+ profile with a set profile picture for this to work!***

1. Go to `chrome://flags`
2. Look for "Enable GAIA profile name and icon"
3. Enable "Enable GAIA profile name and icon"
4. Restart Google Chrome
