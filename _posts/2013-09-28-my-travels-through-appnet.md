There’s a new guy on the block in “realtime feed API” services to take on Twitter, that evil bully, and his name is App.net (to prevent any possible confusion, I’ll just call him ADM from now on). ADN is basically a carbon-copy of Twitter. It provides a real-time post feed, just like Twitter, provides the same @mention method, just like Twitter, and even basically has the same UI as Twitter. Something that separates ADN from Twitter, though, is it’s outlook on users, advertisers, and developers.

Twitter, in recent light, has been playing some nasty tricks on it’s faithful developers. You are limited on how many people can use your Twitter app and recently Twitter has been making huge strides on keeping its users tied to the web interface for its services. That upsets me.

ADN, on the other hand, works in a way that Twitter used to work back in its hayday before many of my friends even used it. There were hundreds of Twitter apps out there in the market and Twitter embraced them all with love and care, giving them some pretty nice APIs and very few restrictions. ADN is doing just the same, pretty much encouraging and recommending third party ADP apps to its users. So what happened to Twitter to make something like APD enter the market?

Twitter is a “free” service that relies on advertisers. The ONLY way that Twitter can turn around a profit is to sell information and ad space to its user-base. I’ve never had a problem with ads, really, as long as I can turn them off, but Twitter doesn’t let me do that, so that upsets me. So how does ADN fight this? How can you make your service run on anything but ads?

ADN has done something so **bold**, so *different*, and so ***brave*** in the marketplace. It’s actually *charging* users and developers for its services. That’s right, you have to pay to use their product. Sarcasm aside, they really are requiring you to pay for it, and I like it that way. I haven’t jumped ship completely to ADN, but I did buy a year-long subscription just so I can see how it develops. It’s actually priced pretty well, recently reducing the yearly price from $50 to $36, introducing a monthly plan at $5, and a developer plan at $100/yr. I think this is pretty much close to where they want to be to get the user-base. So why did I jump? I mean, I still have Tweetbot and Twitter for Mac, and I still like Twitter’s services, and I really don’t mind ads that much, mainly because I can block them (sorry website owners). So why switch?

Well, Tapbots, the creator for Tweetbot and many other fine-crafted apps, created Netbot, an ADN client. Tapbots kept my cool with Twitter’s new API changes because they released a blog post saying how nothing was going to change, and how everything is pretty much cool between them and Twitter. And then Tweetbot for Mac went down to any new users. And now they’ve made an APD client. I don’t know why, but I have this strong feeling that Twitter is really choking Tapbots right now, and they feel like ADN might the be future. I mean, they’ve never made any other client for any other social network besides Twitter, so why ADN? I really trust Tapbots business decisions, because they know where the money is going. Either that, or they really like picking up those Apple fanboys who always want to find the next luxury premium app/service, which Tapbots pretty much is and ADN could be.

Speaking of clients, I’ve been using [Kiwi](http://kiwi-app.net) on OS X, [Netbots](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netbot-for-iphone-app.net/id563595132?mt=8#) on iOS (they also have an iPad app), and [Robin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.rob.client&hl=en) for my Android-powered Nexus 7. They are all great on the feature department, as well as UX.

Anyways, that’s all for now. Let’s see if IFTTT can cross-post this to ADN. It’s losing it’s Twitter posting capabilities because of that new API. Ouch.
