I’m a web/UI designer at heart, not a developer (at least not yet). I’ll be learning C# over the next few semesters at my University, but I still only know HTML/CSS and my basic object-oriented programming knowledge from my programming course in High School (Very basic Java). So I took on a new project. This project will be a little pet of mine just to take a jab at my development skills.

My long-term goals:

- Use version control via Git
- Host with GitHub
- Spend as little time designing and most of the time spent developing

Now, there is a little problem: What in the world am I going to develop? I don’t know what’s wrong with my software life right now, so what do I fix? It turns out, there is a little thing I’ve always disliked: It’s the New Tab page for Chrome. That thing is so ugly and so ordinary, there has to be a good way to replace that thing. So I started thinking of what could I possibly want more?

Let me introduce you to DuckDuckGo. This search engine competing with Google has some really awesome features that I would love to implement with my workflow. I use Alfred for great shortcuts on my operating system, and DDG is a great way to have shortcuts for my internet. So great, I have my project, but what will it do, exactly? I set some more goals/guidelines:

- Use DDG’s !bang syntax as the main search/action engine
- Top search results/instant answers will be displayed inside of the page without leaving using DDG’s APIs
- Apps page for Google Chrome applications, such as Reditr and offline-capable applications
- Build stylesheets with the CSS precompiled language SASS, not regular ol’ CSS
- Minimal and sexy as hell
- Use a custom Bootstrap build
- Random background image on page load
- Pages are made of <div>s, not external files. Increases navigation speed for a little slower load-time and bad SEO (but who cares–it’s just a little personal project)
- Extremely colorful and blurred background for more sexy (and this allows me to compress them hardcore because of how blurry they are!)

So I set off on this little endeavor a few weeks back, and I think I made some good progress! Here’s my New New Tab Page in all of it’s unfinished glory! I worked on it for about a week and took a little hiatus for school (Finals. Yuck.), but now that I am done for this semester, hopefully I’ll be able to tackle the hard stuff, like using DDG’s API (I haven’t even looked at it yet, so I don’t even know what I’m getting myself into) and doing magic JavaScript stuff with it.

I’ve learned a few things so far:

- JavaScript is super-powerful. I’ve been calling it just a scripting language, but man, am I wrong. JavaScript is a programming language. No doubt about it.
- Object-Oriented Programming is amazing. I know just the basics but I could only imagine how hard this would be for a beginner in anything but an OOP language.
- I have fun programming. I have a lot of fun programming. Solving all of those little problems and fixing bugs makes me feel like I’m actually learning/accomplishing with each step I take.
- Git and GitHub are amazing. I just barely know Git, but damn is it cool. Version control is pretty great. Also, having a GitHub account helps me earn some cool-points with some of my professors at my university.

### So. Now what?
Well, now I’m going to get to the hard stuff. Maybe not right this moment (like I said, I’m on a break!), but I’m going to return to this project sooner or later. I have a lot more to learn and a lot more to create. I need to work on getting DDG’s APIs in there and called. I need to render all of the results into HTML. I need to remove all of the junk JavaScript files to help on load times. I need to remove the CSS I’m not using from Bootstrap. That’s a lot of things to do, and I have to deal with all of the bugs that come along the way.

I encourage every user interface designer to take on the programming challenge and to create the applications they’ve been designing all this time–even if it’s just a ‘New Tab Page’ for their personal use.

I’ll update my blog with a new post when I reach the end of my project or if I reach a big milestone. Stay in tune.
