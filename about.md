I am a <script markdown="0" id="age" type="text/javascript">var d = new Date; var n = d.getFullYear(); document.write(n - 1993);</script> year-old born in Vacaville, California, and raised in good ol’ Kentucky. My father, John is a US Navy Veteran from Westminster, California. My mother, Myrna, is from Pasay City in the Philippines. My father’s side of the family consists mostly of German, Irish, & English peoples. My mother’s side is nearly 100% Filipino, with a very slight hint (<1%) of Spanish.

I am an interface and experience designer. I have been learning design since I was in the 7th grade and learning front-end development since I was 14 years old. With over seven years of experience, I can create a design and bring it to life in full-functionality. I have been working with the University of Louisville as a Web Intern since my first semester there. I aid in web projects such as converting 100+ pages from a deprecated design to a new design built with Bootstrap and LESS, or something like redesigning the University of Louisville homepage for mobile devices.

I am also a student attending the University of Louisville. Over the course of four years I will be majoring in Web Development, learning object-oriented programming with .NET and C#.
